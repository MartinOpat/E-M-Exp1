# Repository for raw data, processed data, and data processing code for the course Electricity and Magnetism at RUG
## Contains
### Experiment 1 - Capacitors
* Lab notebook entries, as well as processed data, can be found in `Experiment1/exp1.ods`
* Raw data from each of the three sub-tasks can be found in correspondingly numbered `Experiment1/*.csv` files
* Python code used to plot the graphs can be found in `Experiment1/exp1.ipynb`

### Experiment 2 - Magnetic fields
* Lab notebook entries, as well as processed data, can be found in `Experiment2/loogbook.odt` and `Experiment2/data.ods`, respectively.
* Raw data from each of the sub-tasks A-F can be found in correspondingly numbered `Experiment1/*.csv` files or in the tables in `Experiment2/data.ods`.
* Python code used to plot the graphs can be found in `Experiment2/exp2.ipynb`

(Note: if any of the `.odt` files is not opening, press view raw and the corresponding file should download. Alternatively, on the [main page](https://github.com/MartinOpat/EM-Experiments) you can download all the files using the green "code" button.)
